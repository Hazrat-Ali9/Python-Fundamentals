# 1.ü¶Å Defining a Variable in Python
In Python, a variable is a symbolic name that refers to a memory location where a value is stored. Unlike some other programming languages, Python does not require explicit variable declaration. A variable is created the moment a value is assigned to it


    first_name = 'Hazrat'
    last_name = 'Ali'
    country = 'Germany'
    city = 'Berlin'
    age = 23
    full_name = first_name + ' ' +  last_name
    print(full_name)

    print('I am ' + full_name + '.' + 'I am ' + str(age) + 'years old. ' + 'I live in ' + country)
     print(f'I am  {full_name}. I am {age} years old. I live in {city}, {country}')

    a = 4
    b = 3

    print(f'The sum of {a} and {b} is {a + b}')
    print(f'The difference of {a} and {b} is {a - b}')
    print(f'The product of {a} and {b} is {a * b}')
    print(f'The division of {a} and {b} is {a / b}')
